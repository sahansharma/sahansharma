### 🧠 About Me

```txt
Origin: Curious eyes locked on animated graphs and glowing dashboards.
Awakening: Earned the Google Data Analytics Certificate. Data started talking.
Mission: Decode the tech universe — networking, cybersecurity, AI, and beyond.
```

> I’m driven by code that matters. The type that scales. That breaks old systems. That rebuilds faster.

My obsession?  
To **ship code that leaves a dent**, in milliseconds or in minds.
